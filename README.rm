How do I win?
The game consists of a series of challenges in different categories. You earn points for every challenge you complete. Harder challenges are worth more points.

Each challenge is in the form of a smart contract with an isComplete function (or public state variable). The goal is always to make isComplete() return true.

If you're into that stort of thing, there's a leaderboard.
